asteroids
=========


This game can be run locally by cloning the repo and opening the index.html file with your browser. 

You can also play the game live on the web (hosted by github pages) [at maxpleaner.github.io/asteroids](http://maxpleaner.github.io/asteroids).

A project I made that is similar to this one is (Snake)[http://github.com/maxpleaner/snake].

My homepage is maxpleaner.com
